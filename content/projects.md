## *StormReactor* Water Quality Toolbox
There is a need to accurately model pollutant transformations and real-time control actions at the site and watershed scale. To that end, I built an open-source Python package, [*StormReactor*](https://github.com/kLabUM/StormReactor), which couples the Stormwater Management Model [(SWMM)](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm) with a new Python water quality module. StormReactor includes a variety of predefined pollutant generation and treatment processes, while allowing users to implement more complex processes on their own.

## Water Quality Sampling Nodes
Collaborating with the [Huron River Watershed Council](https://www.hrwc.org/) on a surface water quality monitoring project. I developed a small, low-cost, data node to collect real-time data, make automated decisions, and allow for remote triggering of the samplers. The node sends data to a dashboard allowing a team to monitor the depth of water in the stream/creek, along with sampler information. In manual mode, the team can simply tap a “trigger” button on the dashboard to order a sample.

## Rain Garden Nodes
Collaborating with the [Detroit Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/michigan) on a rain garden monitoring project. I developed a small, low-cost, data node to collect real-time data on soil moisture conditions and infiltration rates.
