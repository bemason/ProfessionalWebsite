## Bio Statement
As a first-generation college student, the desire to become a lifelong learner motivates me to acquire new skills and pursue challenging opportunities. My appetite for knowledge and a bricolage of experiences have transformed me from a liberal arts graduate into an engineer and researcher situated within the field of sustainability. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Civil Engineering, focusing on intelligent systems, at the [University of Michigan](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/). The field of intelligent systems is just starting to bloom, and with it, I, too, will bloom into a sustainably focused, intelligent water systems researcher. 

## Research Overview
# Introduction
* I work with [Branko Kerkez](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/branko-kerkez/) in the [Real-Time Water Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bkerkez/).
* My research seeks to manage stormwater including its pollutants without exponential costs and to hedge impacts from climate change, we can leverage recent technological advances, such as sensors and real-time data algorithms, to enable the next generation of autonomous water systems.

# Intellectual Merit
* Coordinated, autonomous stormwater systems will use sensors and actuators to adapt watersheds to individual storms, reducing flooding and maximizing treatment through real-time monitoring and control at the system-scale. 
* Investigating fundamental knowledge gaps of autonomous systems water resources, environmental engineering, control theory, system system, and machine learning.

# Research Objectives
1. There is a demonstrated need to accurately model water quality processes and real-time control at the system scale. To that end, I built an open-source Python package which integrates the EPA's Stormwater Management Modelâ€™s water balance engine with a new water quality module. *(Completed)*
2. In order to develop a system-scale control strategy, we must first understand what is possible with real-time control (RTC) at the site scale. To that end, I am investigating the amount of pollutant treatment that can be squeezed out of stormwater infrastructure with RTC through simulations and field experimentation. *(Underway)*
3. Based on the data derived from the previous two tasks, I will investigate a systems framework to control water quality in real-time at the watershed scale. *(Future Work)*

# Broader Impacts
* Developing an interdisciplinary, integrated systems framework for autonomous water system.
* Improving the ability of water system managers to make informed decisions by providing real-time monitoring and control capabilities.

## General Research Interests
* Intelligent stormwater systems
* Sensing & control for water quality
* Data-driven policy
* Sustainability
* Diversity in STEM/engineering
