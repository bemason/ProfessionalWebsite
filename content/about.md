## Bio Statement
As a first-generation college student, the desire to become a lifelong learner motivates me to acquire new skills and pursue challenging opportunities. My appetite for knowledge and a bricolage of experiences have transformed me from a liberal arts graduate into an engineer and researcher situated within the field of sustainability. Currently, I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Civil Engineering, focusing on intelligent systems, at the [University of Michigan](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/). The field of intelligent systems is just starting to bloom, and with it, I, too, will bloom into a sustainably focused, intelligent water systems researcher. 

## Dissertation Research Statement
I work with [Branko Kerkez](https://cee.engin.umich.edu/people/branko-kerkez/) in the [Real-Time Water Systems Lab](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~bkerkez/). My research seeks to improve water quality by enabling smart stormwater systems to measure and control stormwater infrastructure. These systems will use sensors and actuators to adapt watersheds to individual storms. My research includes three objectives: 
1. build a toolbox for modeling complex stormwater pollutant treatment and generation processes (completed);
2. drawing from water treatment best practices, determine the optimal stormwater asset placement to maximize pollutant treatment (in progress); and
3. investigate a systems framework to control water quality in real-time at the watershed scale (future work).

## General Research Interests
* Intelligent stormwater systems
* Sensing & control for water quality
* Data-driven policy
* Sustainability
* Diversity in STEM/engineering
