## PySWMM Water Quality Toolbox
Building a toolbox that extends EPA's [SWMM](https://www.epa.gov/water-research/storm-water-management-model-swmm) capabilities to model pollutant transformations. Currently one can model water quality in SWMM, but with limited functionalities. My Python toolbox will provide the ability to run any water quality equation. This toolbox is needed to move the research field forward in order to more accurately model water quality with the ultimate goal of improving water quality.

## Water Quality Sampling Nodes
Collaborating with the [Huron River Watershed Council](https://www.hrwc.org/) on a surface water quality monitoring project. Developed a small, low-cost, data node to collect real-time data, make automated decisions, and allow for remote triggering of the samplers. The node sends data to a dashboard allowing a team to monitor the depth of water in the stream/creek, along with sampler information. In manual mode, the team can simply tap a “trigger” button on the dashboard to order a sample. In addition to manual mode, to improve data collection and reliability, an algorithm is being developed to trigger the sampler autonomously using weather forecast and stream condition data.

## Rain Garden Nodes
Collaborating with the [Detroit Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/michigan) on a rain garden monitoring project. Developed a small, low-cost, data node to collect real-time data on soil moisture conditions and infiltration rates.
